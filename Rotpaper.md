### The Manifesto of the Rotweiler Token ($ROT)

---

## I. Origin

$ROT was born as a decentralized meme experiment on **BNB Chain**, created with the smallest possible value (0.01 BNB).  
It represents the raw instinct of creation — open, free, and without ownership.

A token that belongs to no one, yet can be used by everyone.

---

## II. Vision

The purpose of $ROT is to **inspire decentralized innovation**.  
Artists, traders, builders, and developers are invited to use the token as fuel for new ideas, technologies, and movements.

There is no central team.  
There are no investors.  
Only a symbol — the Rottweiler — representing loyalty, strength, and independence.

---

## III. Philosophy

$ROT is not a speculative asset.  
It is a **social experiment in open creation**.

The value of $ROT comes not from promises, but from participation.  
Its purpose is to **let the community take control** — to build, remix, burn, or evolve it freely.

---

## IV. Supply

- **Total Supply:** 1,000,000,000 $ROT  
- **Launch Value:** 0.01 BNB (on four.meme)  
- **Initial Allocation (~8M $ROT):** held for future community incentives.  
  These tokens are reserved for anonymous distribution to creators, builders, and contributors who strengthen the pack.

No presale. No private sale. No allocation for founders.  
Only open distribution and voluntary contribution.

---

## V. Roadmap (Unwritten)

There is no fixed roadmap.  
The only roadmap is **the collective imagination** of the community.

Each builder, artist, or developer can shape $ROT into something new — a platform, a tool, a culture.  
What $ROT becomes will depend entirely on those who choose to build with it.

---

## VI. License

This document and the $ROT concept are released under an **open-source license (MIT)**.  
Anyone is free to fork, adapt, or redistribute it.

---

## VII. Final Words

$ROT is a reflection of decentralization itself — unpredictable, open, and alive.  
It begins as a meme and evolves as a movement.

> “A pack without masters, a symbol without borders.”

🐾 **The Rotweiler has no leash.**
