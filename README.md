# $ROT — The Rotweiler Token

A decentralized meme experiment built on **BNB Chain**.

$ROT is not a brand, a company, or a promise.  
It’s a **symbol of community power** — a token for builders, creators, and innovators.  
Born from the internet, shaped by the pack.

There is no roadmap. There is no team. There is no leader.  
Only the code, the meme, and the will to create.

- **Chain:** BNB Chain  
- **Total Supply:** 1,000,000,000 $ROT  
- **Launch Platform:** [four.meme](https://four.meme)  
- **Initial Liquidity:** 0.01 BNB  
- **Purpose:** Open experiment in decentralized creativity.
